# some yapping for lore:
- i was doing a direct fetch to the public api in the frontend (exposing my api key right in the fetch url). to fix that security issue, i move the weather feature into the backend. in this way, i can hide my <strong>api key in a .env file</strong> (a server side specific feature)

path for the weather:
