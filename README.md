# Some yapping for lore:
- I was doing a direct fetch to the public API in the frontend (exposing my API key right in the fetch URL). To fix that security issue, I moved the weather feature into the backend. In this way, I can hide my **API key in a `.env` file** (a server-side specific feature).

Path for the weather:
